## CPP Module 08: Generic programing
Generic programming is when a single algorithm is written to work on many data types. 
As programmers, we only have to write the algorithm once: the compiler takes care of 
generating the code for each data type, reducing the need to write duplicate code.
Topics: Templated containers (vector) , iterators, algorithm

# ex00: Easy find
    - Return a pointer to the value to find in a vector of integers
# ex01: Span
    - Create span of integers
    - Add number to the array
    - Find shortest and longest span of the integer vector
# ex02: MutantStack
    - Create iterator functionality for std::stack
