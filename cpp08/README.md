## CPP Module 08: Generic programing
Generic programming is when a single algorithm is written to work on many data types. As programmers, we only have to write the algorithm once: the compiler takes care of generating the code for each data type, reducing the need to write duplicate code.
Topics: Templated containers, iterators, algorithm
